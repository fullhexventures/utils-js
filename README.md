# utils-js

This package contains common Javascript utilities used across Full Hex projects. This is an eclectic collection of code snippets I've built up over my career that tend to be useful in establishing boilerplate for new projects.

This package is open source and available under `fullhex/utils-js` on npm.

Your mileage may vary - No guarantees of support for this project.

## Usage

```
npm install @fullhex/utils-js
```

...


```
import {
    ApiError
} from "@fullhex/utils-js";
```
